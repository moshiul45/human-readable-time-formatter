With this package, you can quickly display time information in ways like \"5 minutes ago,\" \"2 hours ago,\" or as exact durations such as \"01:30:00\" (for 1 hour, 30 minutes). Itâ€™s perfect for adding a clear, natural feel to dates and times in user interfaces, chat applications, logs, or any time-sensitive content.",
